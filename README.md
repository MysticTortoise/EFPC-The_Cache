# Mission Info
THIS MISSION IS NOT DONE!!!! I just want people to beta-test it for bugs and suggestions!!

Known issues:

* The alt route doesn't have most of it's dialogue. I'm saving that for a friend to write.
* Some dialogue may play out of order on the alt route. This will be corrected.
* More will be added. Check here before you DM me about an issue. PLEASE.

I prefer to work on my own and with close friends. Don't ask to help unless I explicitly ask you for help. Thanks!
